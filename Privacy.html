<p>Enmojo Inc. encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Enmojo Inc. so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Enmojo Inc. is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Enmojo Inc. website.</p>

<p>Use of your Personal Information
<p>Enmojo Inc. collects and uses your personal information to operate its Sites and deliver the services you have requested.</p>

<p>Enmojo Inc. may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is transferred to the third party. Enmojo Inc. may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

<p>Use of Cookies</p>
<p>The Enmojo Inc. Sites may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Enmojo Inc. pages, or register with Enmojo Inc. site or services, a cookie helps Enmojo Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Enmojo Inc. website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Enmojo Inc. features that you customized.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Enmojo Inc. services or websites you visit.</p>

<p>Security of your Personal Information</p>
<p>Enmojo Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
